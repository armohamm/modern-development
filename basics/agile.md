- **Individuals and interactions** *over processes and tools*<br>
  Self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming.

- **Working software** *over comprehensive documentation*<br>
  Working software is more useful and welcome than just presenting documents to clients in meetings.

- **Customer collaboration** *over contract negotiation*<br>
  Requirements cannot be fully collected at the beginning of the software development cycle, therefore continuous customer or stakeholder involvement is very important.

- **Responding to change** *over following a plan*<br>
  Agile methods are focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.
