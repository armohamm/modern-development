# About this book

This handbook is a culmination of lessons we've learned in working as a team in building modern web applications. It documents our practices in [Proudcloud] and [Mashupgarage], web development consultancy companies that I'm involved with.
Our practices evolved organically from the [Agile software development] ideas we're rooted in.

## Standard practices

There are no new ideas on this book. Many the points described here are standard practices in teams across the world. All this book does is compile these practices into one book.
