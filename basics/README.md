# The ideal process

The processes you'll learn in this book are all made to achieve a common goal. That goal is to make web development:

- __Sustainable__ - A development team needs a process that it can sustain for months and years.
- __Frictionless__ - Any barriers to getting work done should be minimized, if not removed.
- __Quality-oriented__ - Our process tries to maximize the available talents in each team.
- __Resilient__ - Changes are inevitable and an ideal process should account for that.

These ideas are not new, or unique to our team. In fact, there are established principles that share these goals. One of such is [Agile development](agile.md), which everything in this book is rooted on.
