Feature branches merge into this branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody should push commits directly into this branch. Instead, work starts by creating feature branches from develop. They'll be merged back in when finished. In practice, the develop branch only has merge commits from feature branches.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe develop branch is always in a \"ready to test\" state. All automated tests should always be passing in this branch. You should also set up a staging server to sync with the latest develop version for testing (see automated deployments).The master branchThe master is maintained to be in a production-ready state. While the develop branch is ready for developers and testers, the master branch is ready for users.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of a sprint, the develop branch will be merged into master. This effectively promotes the current development version into a production version. From then, automated deployments will take care of deploying it to production.

This is usually created before, or just around the time, a feature branch is finished.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a pull requestWrite a short title for your pull request.

Simply create a pull request from develop into master and merge it using the GitHub website. This works when master is clean and up-to-date with the latest develop branch, and has no merge conflicts.Merging into a dirty masterIf master has changes that are out-of-sync with develop, you may run into merge conflicts. The only way to resolve this is by using the command line. This is the only time pushing directly into master is acceptable.# Switch to the master branch\ngit checkout master\n\n# Merge develop into master; do a fetch first\n# to ensure we have the latest origin/develop\nget fetch\ngit merge origin/develop --no-ff\n\n# Resolve any conflicts and commit the result\ngit mergetool\ngit commit\n\n# Push into master\ngit push\nSynchronizing developThere are commits in master that are not in develop, it may be a good time to merge those into develop. Make a pull request of master back into develop. Doing this is not necessary, but it will clean up your git history.Creating a releaseEvery deployment should have a version number tag. Simply create a release in GitHub. This will create a git tag for you (equivalent to git tag v1.0.4 master && git push --tags).Create a GitHub release for the latest master.\n\nTag it in the format vX.X.X (eg, v1.0.4).\n\n\n\nCreating a new GitHub release.\n\n\n\n\nNext: Emergency fixes"},"git/hotfix.html":{"url":"git/hotfix.html","title":"Emergency fixes","keywords":"","body":"Emergency fixesThere are times when bug fixes must be made outside the release cycle.

This should trigger your automated deployment process and deploy the hotfix to production servers.Syncing the develop branchOnce the pull request is merged, master now has the fixes, but not develop. In these cases, you can do one of two things:Option A: Merge master back into develop.\n\nOption B: Merge the hotfix into develop as well (\"backporting\").\n\nOption A is preferred in most cases, with option B only being used when merging master back may be too complicated.Self-mergingThere may be cases when fixes are time-sensitive and colleagues aren't available to review and merge your changes.

This isn't the only way to use Git. In fact, the most obvious way to use Git is how the Git manual first tells us to: push all commits to a single master branch.This works for solo developers, but it breaks down once you have two or more on the team. Let's go through the problems that would come up in a single-branch model.Problem: changes aren't contiguous    X - X - O - O - X - O                  X - X - X - O - O - O\n\n    Working on a single branch             Working using feature branches\n    (interleaved)                          (contiguous)\nIf two people are working on 2 features, their commits may end up being interleaved. That is, for features X and O, the commits for either feature may not show up next to each other. This makes reviewing changes more difficult.Problem: changes can't be revertedTo revert a feature that spans multiple commits, all those commits have to be reverted individually.# Single-branch workflow: reverting each commit individually\ngit revert 1a84c2b9\ngit revert 9bf3cb70\ngit revert 6b9c5cb4\ngit revert 215c3820\nGit solves this by grouping multiple commits together into a single merge commit. This is what happens when a pull request is merged. This merge commit can then be reverted, and doing so will revert all commits that it groups together.# Feature branch workflow: only one commit to revert\n# (Assuming 75a6c2a0 is a merge commit)\ngit revert 75a6c2a0 -m 1\nProblem: reviewing is difficult\n\n\n\n\n\nIt becomes harder to review changes when they're not contiguous or grouped in any way. By grouping them together, you can create a GitHub pull request where your peers can browse through your changes easily.The solutionThe Git workflow described in this chapter is a logical evolution brought about by the problems above.

These tasks need to be automated so they can be repeatable and protected from human errors.ExampleFor websites hosted on Heroku, their platform already takes care of deploy automation for you. To update a Heroku website, you simply need to do a git push:# Deploy your app into Heroku's hosting platform\ngit push heroku master\nIn other cases, you'd have to use other tools.

It's completely separate from your production system. This lets your developers, testers, and stakeholders try the latest changes without having to touch the production system.Setting up a staging systemThe most ideal staging setup is a system that's exactly like your production system: same type of server, same type of databases, but hosted separately. You can use a cheaper configuration, since less people will be using your staging.Most projects start with using Heroku for their staging system. It's free, it supports almost every programming language, and setting a new website up takes 2 commands (see Heroku's documentation).Automating staging updates\n\nExample deploy script in Semaphore.\n\n\n\n\nA typical CI setup is have the following auto-deployments done:Auto deploy passing tests in branch develop to your staging server.\n\nAuto deploy passing tests in branch master to your production server.\n\nWhen tests pass in a given branch, an auto deploy script will simply run certain commands.\n\nSetting up auto deployment in Semaphore.\n -->\n\n\nSeeding a staging systemThe data in a staging system is completely different from your production system.

Seeding generates some dummy users, articles, and whatever your project needs to get it to a state where it \"looks\" like a production system.To do this, you'll make a seed script in your project invoked by a certain command.

This seems like a backward thought at first, since writing tests take time. In practice, these tests are automating parts of your workflow, and automation always makes you faster in the long run.F5-driven developmentLet's consider the alternative to TDD. Development in the console usually involves a REPL shell that lets you invoke some code in your project. Here's an example in a typical Rails project:$ bundle exec rails console\nLoading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)\n\nirb> User.new(first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Smith').full_name\n\"John Smith\"\nPeople often abuse REPL consoles as part of their coding process. A common anti-pattern is to use a REPL to test changes as you make them. A typical REPL workflow looks like this:Make some more changes.\n\nPress AltTab to switch to a terminal.\n\nPress Up then Enter to retry the last command.\n\nIn the case of web development, switching to a browser and hitting CtrlR or F5 to reload is also very common. Wouldn't it be easier to automate this process for you?test 'Builds a full name do' do\n  user = User.new(\n    first_name: 'John',\n    last_name: 'Smith')\n\n  expect(user.full_name).to eq 'John Smith'\nend\nBy writing those same REPL commands as a test, you can now re-run it using ruby test/user_test.rb. In fact, you can run all the tests you've ever written!Tests as insuranceTests let you update code mercilessly. Have you ever been in a project that uses very old versions of 3rd-party libraries such as Rails or jQuery? These projects are too afraid to upgrade knowing it may break things.By writing tests, you'll be alerted of breakages when updating your project's dependencies. Changing the jQuery version may make some tests fail. You'd know then where to fix things.Refactoring mercilesslyTests aren't only for upgrading 3rd-party dependencies. Even updating one part in your project can result in breaking another part. A good refactoring process starts with writing tests. When changing code, it helps to know what it can break.Tests as documentationWhile tests are no substitute for formal documentation, it can provide a quick reference for other developers. Consider this test:test('OrderCalculator calculating charges', t => {\n  let order = {\n    type: 'pickup', // or 'deliver'\n    items: [\n      { product: 'Glazed donut', price: 2.99, qty: 2 },\n      { product: 'Coffee', price: 3.99, qty: 1 } ] }\n\n  let charges = OrderCalculator.getCharges(order)\n  t.deepEqual(changes, {\n    subtotal: 9.97,\n    tax: 1.19,\n    delivery: 0,\n    total: 11.16 })\n\n  t.end()\n})\nAnother developer would easily know at a glance what OrderCalculator does, what input it takes, and what results it yields.Next: Enforce code style guidelines through linting."},"coding/linting.html":{"url":"coding/linting.html","title":"Linting","keywords":"","body":"Linting\n\n\n\n\n\nLinters are tools that enforce source code writing style based on a set of rules. It helps impose coding styleguides in an automated way. A linter will check decisions such as:Syntax errors\n\nTabs or spaces for indentation\n\nNaming of variables and functions\n\nUse of whitespace\n\nPatterns to use and to avoid\n\nIt's important to keep your coding style consistent. Even if it's mostly subjective, a consistent style helps maintain developer sanity and code readability.Automated lintingLinting should be part of your automated test suite. This lets you catch style violations before pull requests are merged. Here's an example using Travis CI:# Example .travis.yml configuration to run CS\n# and JavaScript linting\nscript:\n  - npm test\n  - npm run stylelint\n  - npm run eslint\nWhy use a linterLinting helps reviewers by catching style violations in automated tests so they don't have to. This means less effort needed for reviewing, and instant feedback for contributors.\n\nLinting prevents merging when style issues aren't fixed.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a coding styleThere are many established styleguides and linter presets. Pick one and customize it if preferred. It doesn't matter which you choose, what's important is that your team has an authoritative set of rules that are enforced by a linter. This prevents petty \"bikeshedding\" arguments within your team. Here are some popular examples:JavaScript: Standard, XO\n\nCSS: Config standard\n\nRuby: Ruby Style Guide (via Rubocop)\n\nLinter examplesStylelint for CSS\n\nEslint for JavaScript\n\nRubocop for Ruby\n\nCredo for Elixir\n\nNext: Make sure your project has a Readme file."},"coding/readme_files.html":{"url":"coding/readme_files.html","title":"Readme files","keywords":"","body":"Readme filesEvery project should have a README.md file in their Git repository.

This coincides with next sprint's day 1.\nThis is just a sample template; other projects may have longer or shorter QA and feature-freeze days than this, or may not have either at all (not recommended).Never Monday or FridayIt's recommended to start sprints on Wednesday. It can be any day, as long as it's not Monday or Friday.A sprint can't end on a Friday. If something goes wrong on the final release deployment on a Friday, no developers would be around to fix things on the weekend.\n\nFridays are not a good time to start a sprint, either.
