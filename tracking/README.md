<blockquote class='stub-quote'>This article is a stub. You can help by expanding it. <!-- TODO --></blockquote>

- Use a tracker (Pivotal, Trello, GitHub issues, JIRA)
- Write everything down into work items (aka, stories, cards, issues, tickets)
- Everything is either actionable, or going-to-be actionable ("meta")
- Use meta-items to describe very big features
