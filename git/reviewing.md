# Reviewing pull requests

A pull request reviewer has these responsibilities:

- Understand the original author's changes so that the knowledge is shared across the team.
- Review any issues the changes may have.
- Request for changes if necessary.

## Who can review

Anyone on the team can review anyone else's code. Senior members typically do most the reviews in practice, but any member of the team can review pull requests as long as they can satisfy the responsibilities listed above.

The only person who can't review the code is the original author.

As a pull request reviewer, you will be partly responsible for the pull request's code.

## Understanding the pull request

A review will be party responsible for the code's presence in the project. Should anyone have concerns about it in the future, it's going to be the author and the reviewer who should be able to answer these concerns.

A reviewer should also test the pull request, if possible.

## Requesting changes

- Use GitHub's "request changes" facility to request for changes.
- Remove the `For review` tag in the pull request.

When the author's done the changes, it should be tagged back as `For review`.
