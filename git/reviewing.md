# Reviewing pull requests

A pull request reviewer has these responsibilities:

- Understand the original author's changes so that the knowledge is shared across the team.
- Review any issues the changes may have.
- Request for changes if necessary.

## Who can review

Anyone on the team can review anyone else's code. Senior members typically do most the reviews in practice, but any member of the team can review pull requests as long as they can satisfy the responsibilities listed above.

The only person who can't review the code is the original author.

As a pull request reviewer, you will be partly responsible for the pull request's code.

## Understanding the pull request

A reviewer should be awesome
