# Git workflow

For team collaboration to be sustainable, we need to follow a few rules. Our workflow is based on these ideas:

* Everything you do has to be reviewed by someone else.
* It should be easy to review other people's work.
* There should always be a working version (`develop`).
* There should always be a release-ready version (`master`).

> **Next:** Learn about the [*develop* and *master* branches](main_branches.md).
