# Pull requests

GitHub's Pull Request feature is used to ask your team to merge a branch in. This is perfect for our branch-based approach of working in branches and asking your teammates to review them.

## Creating pull requests

Create a pull request from your feature branch (eg, `feature/login`) into the main branch (ie, `develop`). This is usually created before, or just around the time, a feature branch is finished.

Make sure these details are in your request:

- A short description of your changes
- Screenshots, if possible!
- Note if there's anything missing
- Links to relevant issues (in Trello, Pivotal Tracker, and alike)

## Requesting a review

When a feature branch is finished, tag it as *For review* and request for review. It's then your reviewer's job to understand your changes. This way, knowledge is always shared between at least 2 people; there'll be no part of your project that only one person knows about.
