<h1 class='chapter-h1'>Coding practices</h1>

In this chapter, we'll discuss what we can do to make developers work faster without losing their sanity. We'll learn about:

* **Writing tests** - use the test-driven development method to write tests as you write your code.

* **Linting** - automatically enforce guidelines to keep code style consistent.

* **Documentation** - writing an effective `README.md` file to help new developers in your project.

> **Next:** What is [test-driven development](tests.md)?
