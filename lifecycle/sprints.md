# Sprints

The iteration phase is divided into short periods called *sprints*. A sprint is typically 2 weeks long, equivalent to 10 working days. It's a short burst of work focused with short-term goals in mind.

## Typical schedule

- **Day 1: Sprint planning** _(Wednesday)_<br>
  This is a meeting between the whole team where the stakeholders and leads decide on what features to build for the sprint.

- **Day 7 to 10: QA pass**<br>
  This is when the QA team starts testing finished features.

- **Day 9 to 10: Feature freeze**<br>
  This is the bug fixing period. Developers stop working on _new_ features and focus on fixing bugs that were reported by QA, new or old.

- **Day 11: Release** _(Wednesday)_<br>
  The first official release happens after a sprint finishes. For web projects, this means deploying your project to production. This coincides with next sprint's day 1.

This is just a sample template; other projects may have longer or shorter QA and feature-freeze days than this, or may not have either at all (not recommended).

## Never Monday or Friday

It's recommended to start sprints on Wednesday. It can be any day, as long as it's not Monday or Friday.

- A sprint can't end on a Friday. If something goes wrong on the final release deployment on a Friday, no developers would be around to fix things on the weekend.
- Fridays are not a good time to start a sprint, either. People may be too tired to be effective at planning.
- Holidays often fall on Mondays or Fridays, so scheduling releases on Tuesdays helps make things consistent despite holiday schedules.

## The final deliverable

The final result of a sprint is a *release*. It should be a polished, production-ready product to the best of your efforts. Anything incomplete should be removed from the release, and anything almost-complete should be wrapped up before the sprint is over.
