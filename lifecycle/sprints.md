The iteration phase is divided into short periods called *sprints*. A sprint is typically 2 weeks long, equivalent to 10 working days. It's a short burst of work focused with short-term goals in mind.

## Typical schedule

- **Day 1: Sprint planning** _(Wednesday)_<br>
  This is a meeting between the whole team where the stakeholders and leads decide on what features to build for the sprint.

- **Day 6: QA pass**<br>
  This is when the QA team starts testing finished features.

- **Day 10: Release** _(Tuesday)_<br>
  This is the first day the official release. For web projects, this means deploying your project to production.

## Never Monday or Friday

It's recommended to start sprints on Wednesday. It can be any day, as long as it's not Monday or Friday.

A sprint can't end on a Friday. If something goes wrong on the final release deployment on a Friday, no developers would be around to fix things on the weekend. Fridays are not a good time to start a sprint, eitherâ€”people may be too tired to be effective at planning.

## The final deliverable

The final result of a sprint is a *release*. It should be a polished, production-ready product to the best of your efforts. Anything incomplete should be removed from the release, and anything almost-complete should be wrapped up before the sprint is over.
