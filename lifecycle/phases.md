# Phases of a project

There are two phases to a project:

- **Planning** - Research and planning
- **Iteration** - Where the actual work happens

## Launching?

There are many models of system development life cycles ("SDLC") that focus on a product "launch date" when the project is finally complete. Projects are also typically defined as a fixed engagement with a start and end date. These concepts don't apply to our model, which focuses on an iteration cycle.

There's no project "launch". In an agile schedule, every end of a sprint is a launch. It just so happens that you may have one big launch where your site is finally open to the public.

Conversely, there's also no project "post-launch". Other development lifecycle models tell us to measure, maintain, etc... but these should happen every sprint.

There's also no project end-date. In a typical startup project, apps and websites are continually improved. If it's finally feature-complete, then it's time to make new features. A project ends when the stakeholders decide it to end, and these shouldn't be any different from how sprints usually end.

To sum it up, our model focuses on an iteration cycle divided into "sprints". Each sprint is essentially a mini-project that starts and ends.

## Planning

This is where you do your research and design

- Market research
- Product design
- Visual design (UI/UX)
- Planning the next 2-4 sprints
