A milestone is a group of sprints that work toward a common goal. Before a milestone begins, the team must decide on things in this list:

- **Mission** - a goal that this milestone release is meant to achieve.
- **Required features** - features that _must_ be in the final version.
- **Optional features** - nice-to-have features that may be culled if time is short.
- **Projection** - an estimate of how many sprints are needed to accomplish this milestone.

## Sample milestone

For most projects, the first milestone is the minimum viable product, or the MVP. The specifics for Milestone 1 should be decided on in the project's planning phase. Here's an example milestone plan:
