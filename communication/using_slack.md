A team should have these channels for every project:

- A Where everyone is, developers and stakeholders (usually `#general`).
- A developer-only channel (name it whatever you like).

## General channel

> <h4 class='quote-heading'>#general</h4>
>
> *Stakeholder:* Good morning guys, are we still on track for sprint 5?<br>
> *Daphne:* Yep! We should be about 80% there right now.

This channel is for most everything, including collaborating with stakeholders.

## Developer channel

> <h4 class='quote-heading'>#dev</h4>
>
> *Fred:* can you guys take a look at PR #283? I need a review<br>
> *Velma:* Hold on, let me take a look at it.

Have a channel where only developers are present, without any stakeholders. This is where everyday discussions will happen. Banter in this channel is usually not relevant to stakeholders, so it's best to leave them out of it so not to overwhelm them.

## Ephemeral channels

> <h4 class='quote-heading'>#_facebook-campaign</h4>
>
> *Marketer:* We need a new landing page<br>
> *Fred:* We're on it. What do you need?

Create new channels for discussion threads. We usually name these with an underscore, such as `#_feature`.

## Notification channels

- For notifications of your project management tracker and GitHub pull requests (`#issues`)

## Other notifications

- `#analytics`
