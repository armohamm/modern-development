# Introduction

This handbook is a culmination of lessons we've learned in working as a team in building modern web applications. It documents our practices in [Proudcloud] and [Mashupgarage], web development consultancy companies that I'm involved with.
Our practices evolved organically from the [Agile software development] ideas we're rooted in.
