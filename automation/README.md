<h1 class='chapter-h1'>Automation</h1>

There are three things that need to be automated in every project:

- __Tests__ - Automated testing streamlines your team's review process by making sure that changes don't break old behavior.

- __A staging server__ - A server should always be available to test the latest development version.

- __Production updates__ - Updating the production system should be as easy as possible.

The more you automate, the less you worry. The less you worry, the faster you can make progress. These automations can be set up using a Continuous Integration service.
