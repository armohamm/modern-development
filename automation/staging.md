# The staging system

In web development, a staging server is a system where the latest development version is always available. It's completely separate from your production system. This lets your developers, testers, and stakeholders try the latest changes without having to touch the production system.

## Setting up a staging system

Heroku is a good choice.

## Automating staging updates

Set your CI to auto deploy.

> **Next:** Track your code's health with [code coverage reporting](coverage.md).
