# Automated testing

Having a CI test your code automatically is critical in a branch-based Git workflow. Most CI's integrate into GitHub to show.
At the very least, you should have a CI service configured for your project to:

- Run tests in every push to your repository.
- Display test results in GitHub and Slack.

## Setting up automated testing

Set up your CI to run tests on every Git push. The procedure for this varies for every CI service; consult your CI's documentation for details.

When reviewing pull requests, you'll need to ensure that the tests are adequate and passing. A CI service can automate running tests for you.

Most CI services integrate with GitHub and other Git hosting platforms. This lets you see test results in pull requests. This helps enforce good pull request hygiene: every code change needs tests, and they all need to pass before merging.
